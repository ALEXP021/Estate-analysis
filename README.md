# Estate-analysis

Data analysis to predict real estate prices.

The model used a database of approximately 370,000 US real estate records.
Initially, the data was in string form and each feature had to be carefully worked through to extract the information in digital form.

Next, based on the processed data, several regression models were constructed, divided into training, validation, and test samples in a 70-15-15 ratio.

The model on test data gives an error within 5%, which in my opinion is a good result.
